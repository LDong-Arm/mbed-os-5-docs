# Docs CI config

This is the CircleCI config for building documentation from docs repos.

In order to use it, add this repo as a Git subtree to a docs repo under the directory ".circleci". The docs repo can then be built using CircleCI.


## Making changes to the config

When changes are made to this config repo, use the Git subtree command to pull the latest changes to the subtree in the docs repo.
